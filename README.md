Additional notes:

*   I've added a basic structure with sections for features, installation, usage, dependencies, contributing, and license.
*   The dependencies table is populated based on the `package.json` file.
*   Since no license file was found, I've added a note to consider adding one. You can replace `[No license found]` with the appropriate license information (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
*   Consider adding more details to each section to provide a more comprehensive guide for users and contributors. For example, you could include screenshots or GIFs in the "Usage" section, or detailed explanations of the project's architecture in a new "Architecture" section.
*   You can add badges to the top of the README to show build status, version, and other information.
*   I have added a table of contents to improve navigation.
